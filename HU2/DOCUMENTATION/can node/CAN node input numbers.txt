On the PCB from left to right: (left being where the 5V, GND and IN labels are)

ADC xx0321
INT 764321

1:adc1 & pps[3]
2:adc2 & pps[2]
3:adc3 & pps[1]		Does NOT have a 5v pin!
4:adc0 & pps[1]		Does NOT have a 5v pin!
6:	 pps[0], dir=1
7:	 pps[0], dir=0

  Because of a lack of 5V pins on 3&4:
  PPS1, ADC3, and ADC0 should generally be avoided.


Currently this is how it should be set up:

NODE1:
	ADC0 - Steerpos
	PPS3 - RPM left
	PPS2 - RPM right

NODE2:
	ADC1 - Gas 1
	ADC2 - Gas 2
	ADC3 - Brake

NODE3:
	PPS0 - Flow left
	ADC1 - Temp left

NODE4:
	PPS0 - Flow right
	ADC1 - Temp right


To request these values in the MCU, send 0x3D message to the node with as body:
0xAB
where	A = node id
	B = Requested value(pps or adc, so 0-3). Add 8 if it's an ADC value
The first time a node gets this value, it will set up the internal registers to start reading this value
